Redux
we have two types of states 
1. Global level state
2. Component level state

in redux we use global level state
like in e-commerce site our products should be the global state because we want to use them in different components - to read,delete,update,and create some new products 

the way through which state is changed is through reducer or reducer function and is responsible for manipulating and passing the states down in the components...reducer takes "actions" as arguements

actions are just objects that represent the intention to change the state of piece of code
we also have actionCreator which dispatch  or fire of those actions

Terms used in redux
REDUX - A complext state management tool, with a single store as CDS
REDUCERS - Manages the state and returns newly updates state
ACTIONS - Actions have 2 properties types: which is a unique identifier and payload which has data 
DISPATCH - Dispatch is used to send actions to update the data


ex
actionCreator function - getProducts - in this we make a fetch request to get data using axios or fetch
we get that data back and then we dispatch an action reducer and we attach a payload to it and that payload had the data... we can assign that payload to the state and can pass it down to any component
